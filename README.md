### Step 8: Create Users with PowerShell üîß

To automate the process of creating users, you can use a PowerShell script created by [Josh Madakor](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshMadakor)
. This script will create multiple users in Active Directory.

1. **Open PowerShell**  
   - Run PowerShell as an administrator.

2. **Prepare the Names File**  
   - You will need a text file containing a large number of names for the script to access. [Josh Madakor](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshMadakor) provides a text file with around 1,000 random names that you can use.

3. **Reference the PowerShell Script**  
   - Below is the PowerShell script that will create the users in Active Directory:

    ```powershell
   # ----- Edit these Variables for your own Use Case ----- #
   $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS   = "Password1"
   $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt
   # ------------------------------------------------------ #

   $password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force
   New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name _USERS -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false

   foreach ($n in $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) {
       $first = $n.Split(" ")[0].ToLower()
       $last = $n.Split(" ")[1].ToLower()
       $username = "$($first.Substring(0,1))$($last)".ToLower()
       Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan
       
       New-AdUser -AccountPassword $password `
                  -GivenName $first `
                  -Surname $last `
                  -DisplayName $username `
                  -Name $username `
                  -EmployeeID $username `
                  -PasswordNeverExpires $true `
                  -Path "ou=_USERS,$(([ADSI]`"").distinguishedName)" `
                  -Enabled $true
   }

4. Verify User Creation  
After running the script, verify that the users were created successfully by:
- Checking the output in the PowerShell window to see the names of the created users.  
   ![PowerShell Output](https://i.imgur.com/ZbahagJ.png) 

- Opening the **Active Directory Users and Computers** application and navigating to the **USERS** folder in your domain. All the created users should be listed there.

## Testing the Setup üß™ 

### Step 9: Configure Windows 10 Client üñ•Ô∏è 

1. **Create a VM for Windows 10**
   - Create a new virtual machine and select **Windows 10** as the operating system.
   - Allocate resources that make sense for your machine.
   - When configuring network settings, ensure **Adapter 1** is set to **Internal Network**. This setting will allow the Windows 10 client to communicate properly with the internal network and the Active Directory domain controller.  
     ![Network Settings](https://i.imgur.com/inSXypZ.png) <!-- Add a screenshot of the network settings configuration -->
   - Attach the Windows 10 ISO file to the virtual optical drive to begin the installation process.
   - Proceed through the Windows 10 installation.
   - Once installed, update the network adapter settings again if needed to ensure the client is using the internal network.

2. **Change the Hostname and Join the Domain**
   - Go to **Settings** > **System** > **About** and click on **Rename this PC (advanced)**.
   - In the **Computer Name/Domain Changes** window, enter the desired hostname for the Windows 10 client (in this case, I named it **Client1**).
   - Under **Member of**, select **Domain** and enter the domain name.
   - Enter the name and password of an account with permission to join the domain.

   ![Join Windows 10 to Domain](https://i.imgur.com/scMb8Yg.png) <!-- Add an image of the domain join process -->

### Step 10: Verify Network Connectivity üîó

1. **Ping Google to Confirm Internet Access**
   - Open **Command Prompt** on the Windows 10 client.
   - Run the following command to test connectivity to the internet:
     ```
     ping google.com
     ```
   - If the ping is successful, it confirms that the network and NAT configuration on the domain controller was set up correctly, allowing the client to access the internet.


2. **Check DHCP Address Leases**
   - Go to the **DHCP** management console and navigate to the address leases within the scope that was created.
   - You should see **Client1** listed among the leased IP addresses, indicating successful communication between the DHCP server and the Windows 10 client.

   ![DHCP Address Leases](https://i.imgur.com/lgGo2tp.png) <!-- Add an image of the DHCP address leases -->

3. **Verify in Active Directory**
   - Open the **Active Directory Users and Computers** application.
   - You should see **Client1** listed under the **Computers** section, confirming that the client has successfully joined the domain.

   ![Active Directory Users](https://i.imgur.com/8135ncD.png) <!-- Add an image of the Active Directory Users and Computers -->

### Logging in with Created User Accounts üîë
Now that everything is set up, you can log in to **Client1** using any of the 1,000 user accounts that were created. This can be done by selecting the "Other user" option on the login screen and entering the credentials of any of the users created through the PowerShell script.
